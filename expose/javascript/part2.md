1. Line 12 prints the index that has been running through a for loop which until index 3 where it stops the for loop.

2. Line 13 get the last value of prices list where it print a discounted price.
   
3. Line 14 print the last value of the pricces of the discount and make sure that there is no decimal.

4. The function takes the input of the prices and return the discount prices.

5. Line 12 return a code error because the variable i is declare let which means it only can print within the block but not outside the block.

6. Line 13 return a code error because since the variable is a let declaration for discountedPrice which means that it can only be accessed within the block. 

7. Line 14 print the last value of the prices of the discount and make sure that there is no decimal which is the same question 3 and the code run because the final price variable is let declaration.

8. The function takes the input of the prices and return the discount prices which is still the same as question 4 and run the program becuase the variable discounted is within the block of the code.

9. Line 11 return a code error because the variable i is declare let which means it only can print within the block but not outside the block also it is the same as question 5.

10. Line 12 print the length of the input of prices list. Also, since the length has not been redeclare since the length variable is a const declaration which means that it could print the length.

11. The function takes the input of the prices and return the discounted prices. The main reason it could return the discounted prices because the variable discounted has not been redeclared and the a const declaration still let you push a value.
